Live vicariously through someone who took a real scooter ride in Austin. Generate a random ride and, using the trends from the rest of our data, ask yourself if you think this ride resulted in a complaint to 311.

If it is a dot, it is a ride that did not have a significant distance. There are a lot of reasons why a short ride could occur.
