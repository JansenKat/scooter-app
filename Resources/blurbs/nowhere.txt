A huge limitation with our first data set was that we had a lot of rides that went no where. We wanted to embrace this limitation and dig into some of the questions we had about rides that go nowhere. 

Hang out for a second, some of this data takes longer to load, there are a lot of scooter rides. The Y axis is logarithmic because there was such a range in duration. The average ride to nowhere was 2 minutes. One extreme was a 27.6 hour ride to nowhere.
